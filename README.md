## Project Overview

This project consists of a login page where users are prompted to input their date of birth. The system then validates if the user is above the minimum age required to proceed. If the user is too young, they are denied access, and if they meet the age requirement, they are allowed to continue.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a simple age validation system using frontend technologies.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: To structure the login form and age input fields.
- **CSS**: To style the page and make it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: For the logic behind the age validation, ensuring the inputted age is valid.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Enter your date of birth in the appropriate field.
3. The system will automatically validate if your age meets the minimum requirement.
4. If valid, you will be granted access. If not, an error message will be shown.

### Minimum Age Validation

- The age is calculated based on the provided date of birth.
- The user must be at least 18 years old to access the content.

## Installation Instructions

1. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
3. The login page should load, and you can start testing the age validation functionality.

Alternatively, you can deploy the page on any web server for live testing.
